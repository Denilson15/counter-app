# Counter App

This is a custom-built counter application developed from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. While the project idea was inspired by Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Path, the entire design and codebase were independently created to practice building interactive web applications and managing user input.

## ✨ Overview

Live Demo: [https://dainty-fox-6e36ea.netlify.app/](https://dainty-fox-6e36ea.netlify.app/)

This project showcases a functional counter application that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a numerical value. It includes:

- A display showing the current count
- Buttons to increase, decrease, or reset the count
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Users can click the "+" button to increment the count by 1.
- Clicking the "-" button decrements the count by 1.
- The "Reset" button sets the count back to zero.
- The application uses basic JavaScript functions to handle user interactions and update the displayed count in real-time.

## 🛠️ Personalization

Although the initial concept was provided by Scrimba, the following customizations were implemented:

- Designed and styled the layout from scratch using CSS
- Implemented counter logic in JavaScript to handle user interactions
- Ensured responsiveness across various screen sizes

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Add functionality to set a custom increment/decrement value
- Implement keyboard controls for accessibility
- Enhance the user interface with improved styling and animations

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)

- `index.html` – Main structure of the webpage
- `index.css` – Styling for layout and design
- `index.js` – JavaScript for handling counter logic and user interactions

## ⚙️ Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Denilson15/counter-app.git
